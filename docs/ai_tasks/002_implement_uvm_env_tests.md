Implement a UVM environment and base test. Put the environment in src/verif/env and the test in src/verif/tests. 
Create an instance of the wishbone initiator VIP (see packages/fwvip-wb/src/verif for an example). 
Update the 'hvl' testbench to run UVM.
Tie everything into the build flow and ensure that everything compiles.
